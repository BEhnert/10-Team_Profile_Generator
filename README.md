  ### Description
  This application will allow users to build a software engineering team using command-line interface (CLI).  To start, a Manager (1) will be generated via series of questions.  User is then prompted to add either an Engineer, Intern, or Finish the team build.  Once team has been created and Finish chosen, then a 'team.html' page is rendered displaying the full team and certain information for each employee given their role.
